          <p><strong>Instructions:</strong> Thank you for participating in our Ace’s Tracking Survey. As you know, the research is very clear about the fact that children who have meaningful and sustainable relationships with caring adults dramatically improve their chances of success.</p>

          <p>To ensure that no child or youth grows up in our schools or organizations disconnected or “anonymous” we have developed a very simple tracking system based on the description of ACES as a metaphor of the types of valuable relationships adults can establish with children. In order to ensure the integrity and validity of this survey we ask that you review the criteria of each Ace before checking the box.</p>

          <p><strong>Ace of Clubs</strong> – “Other Caring Adults” (all three criteria must be met to check this box)</p>
          <ol>
              <li>You have known the child/youth for at least eight weeks</li>
              <li>You can describe at least three very positive characteristics/skills or talents which you believe this child possesses</li>
              <li>You believe this child feels comfortable asking for your assistance</li>
          </ol>

          <p><strong>Ace of Spades</strong> “High Expectations” (all four criteria must be met to check this box)</p>
          <ol>
              <li>You have known this child/youth for at least eight weeks</li>
              <li>You feel you believe in this child/youth sometimes even more than he/she believe in themselves</li>
              <li>You sense that you are one of the “go to” adults this child may contact if they wish to discuss a problem/issue beyond an academic subject</li>
              <li>You have a very good sense as to this child’s/youth experiences during the non school hours (i.e. a sense of their home life/community life)</li>
          </ol>

          <p><strong>Ace of Diamonds</strong> “Opportunities to Succeed” (all three criteria must be met to check this box)</p>
          <ol>
            <li>You have given this child multiple opportunities to succeed and have acknowledged their success</li>
            <li>When this child is with you they feel a sense of achievement, are valued and appreciated</li>
            <li>This child succeeds in your classroom/program or organization</li>
          </ol>
