<h4>Aces Tracking System©</h4>

<h5>USER MANUAL</h5>
 
<p>Thank you for subscribing to Kids at Hope’s Aces Tracking System. Kids at Hope believes that the Aces Tracking System will truly transform the understanding about what a meaningful and sustainable relationship between adult and child is and how we monitor, validate and document that information in support of all children’s futures, without exception.</p>  
 
<h5>GUIDELINES FOR USE </h5>
 
<p>The Aces Tracking exercise should be utilized a minimum of twice a school or program year.  The first time should be no earlier than 8 weeks into the year so that adults have had a chance to form the meaningful relationships that the Aces Tracking System will trace.  Once all adults have entered the aces they give to children, you will be able to view your results in a Total Aces Report.   From this report you will be able to identify which children you serve have aces and those who have no aces.</p>
 
<h5>Universal Truth #2: Children succeed when they have meaningful  and sustainable relationships with caring adults.</h5>
 
<p>Children with no aces have been identified as not having a single, significant relationship with any adults in your organization.  And the research tells us those children who have meaningful, sustainable relationships with caring adults have a much higher chance of success than children who grow up disconnected and anonymous.  Once the children with no aces or very few aces have been identified, it is imperative to work on connecting those children with adults who care about them. </p>
 
<p>The Aces Tracking System can also be used to identify the adults who connect to specific children should a child need a caring adult at any time they are in your care.  Viewing an Individual Student Report will list out for you every adult in your organization who has identified themselves as having a meaningful relationship with that child.  This resource can prove to be enormously important when working with children on an individual basis. </p>
 
<p>The following instructions will guide you through the set up of your Aces Tracking System.  The power behind the system will come from you and your organization.  So, let’s get started! 
ADMINISTRATOR FUNCTIONS</p>

UPLOAD STUDENT LIST  
Log in as administrator under the School Login box. 
 
The first function you will have to perform will be to Upload your Student List.  Before you can upload your list you will need to create and save it in a CSV file. 
 
Creating a CSV File 
Step 1:  Export your student roster to an Excel spreadsheet 
 
List should be in the following format: 
First Name, Last Name, Grade Level, Student/Member ID  *(Note: The system will only capture the last 3 digits of the student/member ID number).   
 
Please use the following symbols for letter grades: 
P = Preschool 
H = Headstart 
K = Kindergarten 
 
 
Excel spreadsheet will look like this: 
Joanie 
 Cunningham 
 1 
 196 
 
Jason 
 Cunningham

 197 
 
D'Andre 
 Washington

 359 
 
Alexzandria 
 Washington

 360 
 
Dominique 
 Lewis

 361 
 

Once list is imported and formatted in Excel, click file, save as, type in file name and from the drop down choose Save As Type: CSV (comma delimited).  YOU MUST SAVE THE FILE TYPE AS CSV FOR THE IMPORT TO WORK!  If you experience any problems uploading your student roster, check your list again and make sure all fields are filled out properly.  Do not include column headers.  If you continue to have problems, see the last page of the manual for technical support. 
 
Step 2: Click on “Upload Student List” from the menu at the top of the screen

In order to ensure the integrity and validity of this survey, we ask that you review the criteria of each ace before checking the corresponding symbol.  Aces Criteria can be found at the top of the page once you have logged in.
